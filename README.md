MD25
====

An Arduino library for the Devantech MD25 motor controller. Created by Josh Villbrandt (http://javconcepts.com/), July 7, 2012. Released into the public domain.

The majority of this code was stolen from somewhere on the Internet. It has been modified to use the non-blocking I2C library from Wayne Truchsess (http://dsscircuits.com/articles/arduino-i2c-master-library.html).

# Installation

To install, unzip and place the 'MD25' folder into your '\<sketchbook\>\libraries' directory. Then, restart the Arduino IDE and look for the library under "Sketch" -> "Import Library". You can also try the example under "File" -> "Examples".


# Usage

This library implements the I2C functionality of the MD25 motor controllers. The header file is pretty self explanatory, so just read that. Full documentation of the MD25 is in available in the datasheets directory (which were downloaded from http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/md25tech.htm).
